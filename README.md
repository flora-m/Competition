# ACM Competition Shortest Path Algorithms
Course assignment implementing Dijkstra's and Floyd-Warshall algorithms

A Contest to Meet (ACM) is a reality TV contest that sets three contestants at three random city
intersections. In order to win, the three contestants need all to meet at any intersection of the city as
fast as possible.
The contestants may arrive at the intersections at different times, in which case, the first to arrive
can wait until the others arrive.

From an estimated walking speed for each one of the three contestants, ACM wants to determine the
minimum time that a live TVbroadcastshould lastto covertheirjourney regardless ofthe contestants’
initial positions and the intersection at which they finally meet. You are hired to help ACM answer this
question.

You may assume the following:
• Each contestant walks at a given estimated speed.
• The city is a collection of intersections in which some pairs are connected by one-way streets that the contestants can use to traverse the city. Two intersections can be connected by two one-way streets allowing travel in opposite directions of each other.
